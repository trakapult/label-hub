Thunder rumbles in the distance, a harbinger of the storm that brews within. Eyes narrow to slits, ablaze with the seething fire of righteous indignation. Injustice becomes a catalyst, igniting the flames of fury that burn with an intensity that cannot be quenched. Every injustice, every betrayal, fuels the inferno that rages within, a force of nature unleashed upon an unsuspecting world. In the crucible of anger, reason is consumed by the fire, leaving only the primal roar of defiance in its wake.
