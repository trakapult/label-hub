The world moves on, oblivious to the pain that lingers like a bitter taste upon the tongue. Smiles are exchanged like currency, masking the cracks that run deep beneath the surface. Loneliness becomes a constant companion, its presence suffocating in its familiarity. Dreams wither and fade, like flowers wilting in the harsh light of reality. In the depths of despair, even the simplest tasks feel insurmountable, each moment stretching into eternity with no end in sight.
