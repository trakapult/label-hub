Silence hangs heavy in the air, broken only by the soft sound of footsteps echoing down empty hallways. Shadows dance across the walls like ghosts of forgotten dreams, haunting reminders of what once was. Tears fall like raindrops, tracing pathways down cheeks worn smooth by the weight of sorrow. Each breath feels like a struggle, as if the very act of living is a burden too heavy to bear. In the depths of despair, even the brightest lights seem dimmed, their warmth unable to penetrate the darkness that shrouds the soul.
