The world outside the window is painted in shades of gray, mirroring the heaviness that weighs upon the soul. Raindrops cascade down the glass, a somber symphony that echoes the melancholy within. Memories of happier times flicker like distant stars in a vast, empty sky, unreachable and fading with each passing moment. The heart aches with a profound sense of loss, as if a piece of it has been torn away, leaving behind a hollow emptiness that cannot be filled.
