The world becomes a battlefield, each heartbeat a drumbeat of defiance in the face of injustice. Fists clench, muscles tense, as adrenaline courses through veins like molten lava. Injustice burns like acid, corroding the soul with its toxic touch. Every injustice, every slight, fuels the fire of fury that rages within, an inferno that knows no bounds. In the crucible of anger, righteousness becomes a sword, wielded with unrelenting force against the forces of oppression.
