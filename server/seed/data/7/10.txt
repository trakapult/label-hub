The darkness closes in like a suffocating shroud, swallowing the light and leaving nothing but an abyss of uncertainty. Every sound is magnified, echoing through the stillness like a scream in the night. Goosebumps prickle across the skin, a silent testament to the primal fear that coils like a serpent in the pit of the stomach. In the silence of the night, every shadow becomes a specter, every rustle a whisper of impending danger. In the grip of fear, even the bravest soul is reduced to a trembling child, lost in a world of nightmares.
