Shadows dance on the walls, twisting and contorting into sinister shapes that seem to mock the trembling figure huddled in the corner. The air grows heavy with the weight of unseen terrors, each creak of the floorboards a harbinger of imminent doom. Heart pounding like a drumbeat of dread, every nerve is stretched taut with the anticipation of what lurks in the darkness beyond. In the grip of fear, rationality crumbles like ancient ruins, leaving only the primal instinct to flee from the unknown.
