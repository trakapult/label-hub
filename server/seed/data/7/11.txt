Eyes wide with terror, the world becomes a blur of frenzied motion and panicked breaths. Sweat beads upon the brow, cold and clammy against fevered skin. Every heartbeat is a drumbeat of dread, counting down the moments until the inevitable descent into madness. In the grip of fear, reason is but a fleeting whisper, drowned out by the deafening roar of primal instinct. Every shadow becomes a specter, every creak of the floorboards a harbinger of doom. In the darkness of the unknown, fear becomes the only certainty, a relentless force that consumes all in its path.
