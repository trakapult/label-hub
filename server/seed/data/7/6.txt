Flames of fury rage within, a tempest brewing beneath a calm facade. The air crackles with tension, charged with the raw power of pent-up emotion. Words become weapons, sharp and cutting, slicing through the silence like a blade through flesh. Every fiber of being trembles with the intensity of the inferno roaring within, a force too potent to contain. In the crucible of anger, reason is consumed by the flames, leaving only the searing heat of indignation in its wake.
